SoH estimation README
This repository contains Python code for comparing the errors in State of Health (SoH) estimation using two different input types: voltage responses corresponding to constant current (CCCV) and pulse current applications. The code utilizes a Keras Sequential model for SoH estimation.

Input type:
	'cc' : Uses section of CCCV voltage response
		Range of SoC and the length of the sections can be sepcified
		
	'pulse' : Uses pulse current voltage response
		Type of pulse input can be sepcified

Outputs
	soh : discharge capacity at each RPT
	r_C3_30soc : resistance using 2 A current at 30% SOC
	r_C3_50soc : resistance using 2 A current at 50% SOC
	r_C3_70soc : resistance using 2 A current at 70% SOC
	r_C4_30soc : resistance using 4 A current at 30% SOC
	r_C4_50soc : resistance using 4 A current at 50% SOC
	r_C4_70soc : resistance using 4 A current at 70% SOC
	r_C5_30soc : resistance using 6 A current at 30% SOC
	r_C5_50soc : resistance using 6 A current at 50% SOC
	r_C5_70soc : resistance using 6 A current at 70% SOC
