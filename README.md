SOH estimation of NMC cells using 2 different voltage response as input : 
  (i) voltage response corresponding to constant current, 
  (ii) voltage response corresponding to pulse current


Rawdata contains the voltage profiles and state values of 48 NMC cells

Code contains the python code for processing the data and estimating SoH. Further info is located in the folder.
